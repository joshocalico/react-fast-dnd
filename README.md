# React Fast Drag 'N Drop
A slightly experimental drag and drop system for React.

## Project goals
- To create a drag and drop engine with minimal overhead. 
- To reduce memory and system requirements for drag and drop on large trees.
- To provide optional events and UI components, both as example and to cover common use cases.
